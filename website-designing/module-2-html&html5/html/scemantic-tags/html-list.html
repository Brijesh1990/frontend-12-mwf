    what is html list ?
    An HTML list is a structured way to present a collection of related items or information on a webpage. Lists are commonly used in web development to organize content, improve readability, and enhance the overall user experience. There are two main types of HTML lists: ordered lists and unordered lists.

    1. Ordered List (<ol>): An ordered list is used when the sequence of items matters. Each item in the list is typically numbered or lettered to indicate its position in the sequence. The <ol> tag is used to create an ordered list, and each item within the list is defined using the <li> (list item) tag.


    Example of an ordered list:
    <ol>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ol>

    2. Unordered List (<ul>): An unordered list is used when the sequence of items does not matter. Items in an unordered list are typically marked with bullet points or other symbols. The <ul> tag is used to create an unordered list, and each item within the list is defined using the <li> (list item) tag.

    Example of an unordered list:
    <ul>
        <li>First item</li>
        <li>Second item</li>
        <li>Third item</li>
    </ul>

    3.nested List : A nested list is a list that contains another list within it. This can be done with both ordered and unordered lists. Nested lists are useful for creating hierarchical structures or subcategories within a main list.


    Example of a nested list: 
       <ul>
        <li>Fruits
            <ul>
                <li>Apple</li>
                <li>Banana</li>
                <li>Orange</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Vegetables
            <ul>
                <li>Carrot</li>
                <li>Broccoli</li>
                <li>Spinach</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
